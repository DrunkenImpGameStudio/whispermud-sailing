command: sail
body: |
  Charter a ship across the ocean to another port. Sea travel takes time, so get comfortable and try not to let the seasickness get to you. 
  
  This command only works in Ports. To view the possible destinations, look for a sign containing destinations and a number. Type `travel <#>` to travel to that numbered destination, if there are any.
  
  Usage:
  - sail <#>
  - travel <#>
